                            I first learned the fundamentals of building an interactive Frontend with React
                            , and
                            then leading into learning how to Respond to Complex User Input and Displaying data from an API. <br />
                            For the last 4 weeks I learned how to Implement Navigation with React Router and using a Database with Supabase.
